# Composer Tutorial
A walk through of various Composer tasks.

[Composer](//getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP. It downloads
public PHP packages (projects, libraries, etc) from Packagist.org.

Each step in this tutorial goes over basic Composer usage. The original tutorial for this in the following git repo:
https://github.com/david-hernandez/composer-tutorial

## Background
The steps in this tutorial are based on building a [Drupal 8](//drupal.org) project with
Composer, since that was the original motivation for the tutorial. However,
most of what is explained is specific to Composer, not Drupal, so the
information should still be relevant to any PHP project. And since the Drupal 8
use-case is more complex than simple "Hello, World!" functionality, it shows
some of Composer's possibilities.

## Before you begin

You may seem the environment performing some setup tasks. It is installing Composer for you. If it is still working as 
you start step 1, just let it finish. It should only take a moment.
